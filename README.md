# Quantum Dynamics project by Eduardo Villase√±or and Eoin Horgan

## File Descriptions:
simulation.py: Contains the simulation class, with methods to initialise and evolve psi.

matrix.py: Functions for building discretised Hamiltonians, in 1 and 2D.

quantum_plots.py: Functions for making animated plots of the wave function and potential.

potentials.py: Functions for buliding vectorised potential functions.

potentialWell.py: A showcase/prototype which simulates behaviour near a potential well and plots it.

compare_times.py: Compares the time taken to sove the system by various different scipy functions.

## TODO:
* 2D system surface animations 
* Different potentials
* Dispersion
* Quantum Billiards
