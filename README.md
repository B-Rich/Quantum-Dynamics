# Quantum Dynamics project by Eduardo Villase√±or and Eoin Horgan

## File Descriptions:
Report.ipynb - IPython notebook showcasing several uses of the simulation.

simulation.py - Contains the simulation class, with methods to initialize and evolve psi.

matrix.py - Functions for building discretized Hamiltonians, in 1 and 2D.

quantum_plots.py - Functions for making animated plots of the wave function and potential.

compare_times.py - Compares the time taken to solve the system by various different scipy functions.

### Examples:
potentialWell.py - A showcase/prototype which simulates behavior near a potential well and plots it.

gaussian_1D.py - 1D Gaussian potential.

doubleSlit.py - 2D simulation of a plane wave encountering a barrier with two equally sized apertures.

scattering.py - 2D simulation of a plane wave deforming around a point which has 1/r^2 repulsion.

billiards.py - 2D simulation of multiple circular waves interacting in the presence of a dispersion potential.
